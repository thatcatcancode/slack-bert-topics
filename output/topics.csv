I believe in learning by teaching, so I'll try to answer your questions too, if you have them.\n\nWe'll be seeing/reading eachother around! :star2: Cheers!",2.0

"<@U019BCGD0QY> and <@U010L66PJ6N> Thank you for your valuable comments!\nRolling back a bit I like option 1 more, it's probably more flexible and future proof. Yet a case can still be made for a more simpler model using option 2 (M-M directly from Role).\nHaving said that, here's some further questions on option 1 including your suggestions\n\u2022 I would prefer to follow the path of least FAB model overriding. That's why I chose to just change the `ViewMenu` model. Also using `obj_type` , `obj_id` is interesting but auto MVC CRUD or auto API CRUD has no way to infer the relation between objects ( probably not a show stopper since we can always custom develop the UI and backend ), but we would loose free constraint integrity from the DB also. So 2.a but using normal SQLAlchemy relations\n\u2022 4.b do you mean using `can_access.dashboard` to refer to a permission that allows to access all dashboards?\n\u2022 By adding a `can_edit` or `can_read_write` permission, we could potentially drop the `owners` concept. I imagine that it's not easy to maintain a list of specific users for each dashboard. Probably better to group users with roles that gives them permission to edit (owners). (We add complexity and also remove complexity)\nNote: Following this new structure we can have data access permissions and dashboard access permissions at the same time and still support the current logic.\nNote: This is a big change, that I think we should eventually make, would love to ear from <@U7HPM7JHL> and <@UH0UPCJVD>",2.0

"<@U018H0JE06M> hi there, Superset can\u2019t query external data API\u2019s directly. Superset has to work with a supported database or data engine (<https://superset.incubator.apache.org/installation.html#database-dependencies>). This means that you need to find a way to fetch data out of the API and store it in a supported database / data engine. Some options:\n\n\u2022 Build a little Python pipeline that will query the data API, flatten the data to something tabular / relational, and upload that data to a supported data source - <https://superset.incubator.apache.org/installation.html#database-dependencies> - and set up Superset so it can talk to that database / data engine.\n\u2022 For more robust solutions, you may want to work with an devops / infrastructure to stand up a workflow scheduler like Apache Airflow (<https://airflow.apache.org/>) to regularly ping this API and store it in a database of some kind that Superset can talk to.\n*Either way, Superset is just a thin layer above your database / data engine.

"Hi,\nI've been trying to get the teradata driver working as per the documentation, had a lot of issues. I've been working with Teradata and python for a long time and I know that the driver thats used in Superset is pretty old and there is a much newer teradata driver for python called teradatasql. I was able to add this in to superset as a database engine, and eventually run a query in sql lab.\nThe problems that I'm seeing are, on the add data source, I can do a test connection and get a success or bad password back with no problem, but adding the datasource runs forever and eventually crashes out.\nI gave up and eventually created it on the Superset CLI, which worked a treat.\nThen in the SQL Lab I wanted to test this out, I ran a couple of small queries, worked fine but eventually it stopped returning anything. Even queries that should run in a second and return just 1 row weren't returning.\nAnyway, I think both issues are due to the number of schemas on our database, which is over 2700. I noticed the SQL lab is trying to return them all and I'm guessing when we create the connection it does the same thing. Anyone know if I can turn this off or limiting how many schemas are returned when defining the new engine.\nI think teradata using the newer teradatasql and teradatasqlalchemy python libraries would be easy to add, but I'm just struggling to test it.",2.0

"Hello Everyone! I have a problem on the overall CSS of the Dashboards created in Superset. While I found very useful the Edit CSS button available. I was able to edit the dashboard's CSS to accomodate the style requirements. But I am probably doing it the wrong way. I found the names of some of the div elements and classes of the dashboard by using the developer tools of my internet browser and browse through the different elements. I am stuck at the overall layout of the dashboard elements. The containers with the slices are in my opinion too separated from each other resulting in too much negative white space. I have tried to change the width of the dashboard to a set number of pixels but I was not able to select all elements. The problem is common to all dashboards. The Birth Names Dashboard, shipped with Apache Superset is affected by the same problem. The image above shows an example of the problem. The black dotted line shows the white space I am trying to reduce. There are two elements (one is a chart and the other a markdown element) that have too much padding and too much negative space. The third element is the body of the page.\nI have tried to change margin and padding parameters of the different elements in the Live CSS editor but I have not found the right one yet.",1.0

"Hey everyone, I'm trying to build a table with time comparison metrics such as last 7 days production, prior 7 days production etc. using time series table. Then I found out that all Superset charts are related to a time column which we have to select from the data source itself. The thing with using time series table functions is that it relates to this time column instead of calendar date. So the last 7 days metric was actually the sum of values based on the latest 7 dates entry (from time column) related to it not last 7 days calendar date. Is there a way to have this sum L7D metric based on calendar date in Superset? I'd really appreciate your help, thanks!",1.0

Hi\n\nI want to enable scheduled email reports in superset (set up with docker). I installed geckodriver and firefox-esr but yet it doesn't work. It gives timeout (5min but the page itself loads less than 30s) or various other errors. Does anyone knows how to handle this or have a working config of superset inside docker which supports scheduled email reports?\n\nSome of the errors:\n```NoSuchWindowException: Browsing context has been discarded```\n```Failed to decode response from marionette```\n```selenium.common.exceptions.InvalidSessionIdException: Message: Tried to run command without establishing a connection```\n```selenium.common.exceptions.TimeoutException: Message: Timeout loading page after 300000ms```\n,

This is how I'm handling permissions to specific groups.,
The Dashboard and charts have a field called Owners. Its not a very centralised way of managing users and permissions but it could help with your problem. This field can be populated via a DB insert statement so you dont need to do this via the superset UI.,

Way too much noise.\n\nTags will increase the value of Superset for business stakeholders by ~2-3x.,

Excited to announce the first cohort: <@UT51H29FS> <@U010L66PJ6N> <@U013M8WTVV2> <@U015ZU8GRDH> <@U0131V7SMEE> :clap: :tada: . They will be publicly identified with a Superset badge in their Display Name, so you can always find them. NOTE: they are all volunteers w/ day jobs, who love using Superset and want to help others do the same. We are very grateful for their participation. Please treat these champions with patience and respect! (If you are interested in being a part of this program, we will open it up for new participants every few months or so, so stay tuned for future announcements.)\n\n3. Lastly, an FYI: next Monday is my last day at Preset as I wrap up my consulting work on this initial phase of community building of Superset. Really enjoyed meeting (virtually) so many of you! Hopefully my presence here was helpful in some way, shape or form. I will continue to lurk around here w/ a different account (lurking in OSS communities is kinda my favorite thing to do :wink: ). Obviously, there's so much more community building that needs to be done; *community is really a long-tail game that rewards patience and persistence*. Preset is hiring for that role! Here's the job posting, and ping <@UTQAXQT6H> if you have any questions: <https://jobs.lever.co/preset/5e4da393-0550-468d-aaca-0bc8721bab03>\n\nDon't be strangers.

I actually didn\u2019t think of that. Our CSVs are like 100-500GB.,
Anyone happen to have any insights on the best way to utilize a custom plugin in a production environment? I developed one locally and all is well but will I need to be using the same dual repos strategy (ie. incubator-superset AND superset-ui with \u201cnpm link\u201d to core and my custom plugin) working in tandem in order to make use of it in any other non development scenario?,
have you already tried runing `superset init`  ?,
<@UKQ7FMSE4> I fixed the k8/Helm deployment. Now I need to know where I can modify the size limit for an upload. Because the CSVs I have are roughly 350GB-500GB in size.,

I would originally use the _*edit chart*_ option via the dashboard or do a Cmd+F on the browser on the charts page to search for a chart but this only works when the chart names are unique across dashboards.\nBut I just discovered a very neat feature. Which is really what Tags does.  We can set the description of the chart and then do a search based on description of the chart via the *FILTER LIST* option on the charts page.,

Hello i would like to ask a question\nI would like to build a dashboards for an open source project called openproject.\nI was struggling on how would i do it since openproject table structure is not straightforward.\nExample:\n```Main Table (work_packages) *\n| No. | task_id | project_id | type_id\n\nType \n| No. | name | \n\nType Field\n| No. | type_id | name |\n\nType Values *\n| No. | task_id | type_field_id | value```\nI want to make a dashboard where work_packages would also consider showing the extra fields coming from the Type &gt; Type Field &gt; Type Values.\n\nThanks a lot and sorry for the long question.,

Using mysql 5.7 and superset 0.37\n\n```sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (MySQLdb._exceptions.OperationalError) (1366, ""Incorrect string value: '\\xC5\\x9F\\xC3\\xA7si...' for column 'slice_name' at row 1"")```",
"Hey guys! I have been giving the platform a spin for a couple of days and so far love it, but I haven't been able to find what is to us a critical feature.\nOur users need to be able to colour columns in table charts and add conditional formatting; e.g. make a cell more red based on the value (as seen in spreadsheet software such as Excel and Google Spreadsheets). This is a critical feature for us and I have to say I really like the platform so far. I hope this is possible, let me know!",
I see it's easy to filter on an individual chart. I'm not seeing a way for a user to dynamically do it for a whole dashboard...?,

"Hey all! Just wanted to say thanks for all the awesome work being put into Superset! It's a really great tool. We've been using it for the past 6 months as one of the main entry points into our warehouse. We have just over 100 users using it atm. Our stack is mainly Druid, Presto, and MySQL. My feedback on superset is definitely positive, however like anything, it for sure has it's pain points. Just figured I'd share some of them that we face:\n\n\u2022 Large CSV dumps.  Nothing bothers me more than when a user complains about it as most of the time a user wants to download a CSV bigger than even excel can even open, however I've grown to understand this need a bit more from users. Often times, there's integrations someone from marketing, accounting, etc needs to run to push to an SFTP bucket or something equivalent, and although they likely can't even open the files themselves, sometimes these are for POC's for some integration a team is looking to test out. I totally understand the limitation that superset renders the results in the browser, however just sharing the pain point there.\n\u2022 Users leaving auto refreshing dashboards on. It's common for a user to have an auto refreshing dashboard open, leave their browser window open, and have it run a really complex Presto query every 10 seconds. This adds a lot of load onto our Presto cluster or other parts of the stack, and we end up having to reach out to users to close their browser windows. Ideally, there's something in the FE that stops an auto refreshing dashboard from running after X time (might be a good administrator setting)\n\u2022 Presto doesn't show catalogs or schemas in SQL lab. It's pretty confusing to explain to users how to query presto via superset when they can't see the catalogs themselves (you can tell them to run `show catalogs` but this is hard to explain to a lot of people). I might be missing a setting or something for this, and if there's something I don't know on this, would love to know how I can add this (our presto cluster is connected to 6 different sources)",

The meeting isn't a secret by any means. There are in fact *88* people on the calendar event, and more are welcome!\n3. Synchronous meetings have a value to them that's not easily replaced by email. Discussions happen around technical work taking place on certain PRs or other work. Asking and answering questions conversationally is often quite effective.

<@UH0UPCJVD>\nThis is the was <@UFG3USN8K> is working on which is basically a filter for favourites <https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11083|https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11083>\n\nThis is the same way we implements the dashboard level access single responsibility of filters in the filters.py file,
I\u2019d love to hear <@UFG3USN8K>\u2019s thoughts on how this can be implemented in a way that doesn\u2019t introduce unnecessary complexity.,
"My main concern is that we should be careful not not to make an already complex and loaded permission model even more complex than it currently is. One major risk I see is if we have multiple overlapping permission structures, it can become difficult to resolve situations where customers either see or don\u2019t see the data that they need.",
"I have seen multiple instances in a previous role where stakeholders from different organisations wanted to use the same datasource but wanted to restrict dashboard access, in part to not expose how the metrics and how they were using the data. So I do understand where Amit &amp; team\u2019s requirement is coming from.",
I'll add all the relevant context to the SIP itself,
Beside that dashboard level access is a repeated requirement over years now in superset in many issues mentioned before mine \nI'm for sure not alone in this depending only on data source access doesn't seems sufficient enough when involving external clients\n\nAlso think about the following overhead :\nDashboard A consists of a single datasource A and there there hundreds of users watching it \nThe. After a while the dashboard get edited with an additional datasource.\nThen immediately all those hundreds of users loose accesss to the dashboard .\nIf it was dashboard level access it won't ever happen,
It is not that no data source existing on Dashboard is that the dashboard specific endpoint /view are not being enforced by any security measure and there might by PII even when data sources are not available,
e.g. if there will be fake datasource behind markdown / iframe + row level security - would it solve the problem ?,
I have skimmed through the SIP and I definitely lack the context on the problem you are solving &amp; what are the blockers in current implementation,
usually I approach problems like this in such order:\n\u2022 understand the scope of the problem &amp; user use cases\n\u2022 figure out if it can be achieved in current architecture &amp; primitives with the small tweaks\n\u2022 if not -&gt; what is a good technical solution &amp; alternatives,
